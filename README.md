# Augustus-s-home-server

Description:

A Linux based(Ubuntu) home server capable of being a remote cloud storage and hosting games with 24/7 uptime and no afk kick

Why i made it:

i chose to make this mostly because i wanted a remote cloud storage i can access anywhere in the world and a minecraft server that doesnt kick you for being afk and is up 24/7.

The server as it stands
